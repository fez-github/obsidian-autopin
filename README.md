# Autopin
When installed, any note that is clicked on will automatically be pinned.  If you click on a note that is already pinned, you will be moved to that note.  This plugin was made with the obsidian-sample-plugin as a base, and was an exercise for me to get used to Obsidian's TypeScript API.

## Installation:
At the moment this plugin is not available for download in Obsidian's Community Plugins.  If you wish to install this, clone the repository inside your Obsidian Vault's plugin folder with `git clone`.

## Bugs:
At the moment there is a bug where a duplicate note will open if you click on a note that has been pinned, and then click on it again.
